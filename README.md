# Cyclistic-Capstone-Project-
I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, and the final part of the course was a capsone project in order to add to your portfolio

The project presented was about Cyclistic: A bike-sharing scheme with 600 docking stations and over 5,800 bicycles. In addition to providing cargo bikes, hand tricycles, and reclining bikes, Cyclistic distinguishes itself by extending bike share accessibility to individuals with disabilities and those unable to operate a traditional two-wheeled bike.

You got to choose 12 consecutive months of data to analyse - i went for the year of 2022. Here, you can explore our project that delves into 12 months of data using the Divvy trip data from Chicago [https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html].

You could choose which platform you wanted to analyse the data, i chose SQL as i felt most comfortable with it and i couldnt fit all the data into R
