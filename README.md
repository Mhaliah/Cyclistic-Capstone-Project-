# Cyclistic-Capstone-Project-
I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, and the final part of the course was a capsone project in order to add to your portfolio

The project presented was about Cyclistic: A bike-sharing scheme with 600 docking stations and over 5,800 bicycles. In addition to providing cargo bikes, hand tricycles, and reclining bikes, Cyclistic distinguishes itself by extending bike share accessibility to individuals with disabilities and those unable to operate a traditional two-wheeled bike.
